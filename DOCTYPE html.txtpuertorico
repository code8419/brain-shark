    <h3>WHY</h3>
      <p>When I was younger  would travel to Puerto Rico to visit my father. I        I remember getting there and just falling in love with the view. The          tall green mountains that sorrounded us 360 degree my eye candy for a          kid like me at the time there were mango trees quenepas palcha star            fruit. I remember fallowing my grandfather around to collect green            bananas from the few dozen banana tree my grandparents had. I know if          you ever visited Puerto Rico lets say 15 years ago and was to visit now        i know you would see the diffrence its still a beutiful place as it            will always be its my birth place, my culture and my kids culture and          our cultures future it our mother as long as we can preserve it i wrote        that to say this our mother needs help and push to replant puerto rico        i iwould love for my grand kids to be able to take the same trip i took        and tressure those memories since its one of the last things to go when we are gone
